Arcade Game
===============================

Instructions:

This is an arcade game inspired by the popular arcade game, Frogger. Play the game by moving the player with the arrow keys (up, down, left, right). Avoid the bugs moving across the screen; if you hit one, your player will be moved back to the starting location. Win by making it to the river.
